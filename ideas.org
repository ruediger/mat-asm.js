* TODO freeing matrices/vectors.
We can't use the GC because =asm.js= lacks support for it.  But at least manual
free should be supported.  This requires a change of internal memory
management.  One solution would be to use a "free list" to contain
pointers to freed data fields.  This would however require a bit of effort to
implement in =asm.js= or require the use of the FFI.
* TODO interoperability.
Vec3 and Mat4 live on separate heaps.  The FFI has to be used to make the
interoperable.  Monitoring the performance impact is important.  Merging the
heap of Vec3 and Mat4 would avoid this but make heap management far more
complicated.
* TODO finish mat4
* TODO optimize
* TODO benchmark
* TODO world peace
